    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a <i>stylesheet language</i> that
      describes the presentation of various markup languages like HTML and SVG.
    </p>
    <p>CSS is a <i>rules-based</i> language. Rules look like this:</p>
    <pre>
      selector {
        property1: value1;
        property2: value2;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      <i>Selectors</i> tell the browser <b>which</b> nodes to apply
      <i>styles</i> to in the <i>DOM</i>.
    </p>
    <p><i>Properties</i> specify <b>how</b> to style the <i>node</i>.</p>
    <p>
      <i>Values</i> can be strings, colors, px, rem, numbers, %, or other types
      depending on the property type. It's important to understand how CSS works
      to apply styles to the DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's not very important to memorize lots of the selectors and style
      properties. You'll naturally build up a knowledge of your most commonly
      used selectors and style properties over time with practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Try It!</h2>
    <p>Edit this page to include the following CSS inside the "style" block:</p>
    <pre>
      body {
        margin: 0 auto;
        width: 95%;
        max-width: 440px;
        background-color: mintcream;
      }
    </pre>

    <p>
      The page should now be looking a bit more centered. We've added a
      centering technique using the "margin" property (more on how that works
      later), a "width" value of "95%" (95% of the width of "body"s parent
      node), a "max-width" of "440px" (440 pixels), and a "background-color" of
      "mintcream" (...delicious!).
    </p>

    <h2>Visual Heirarchy</h2>
    <p>
      Let's tune up the font to make the visual heirarchy more clear. On this
      page, the header elements "h1" and "h2" are the most important in the
      visual heirachy. You can increase/decrease an elements position in the
      visual heirarchy by modifying its size, spacing, color, background, to
      make the elment more or less visually interesting. "Visual heirarchy" is
      the design principle of arranging elements in the interface in a way that
      illuminates the order of importance.
    </p>
    <div class="sidenote">
      Squint test: squint your eyes to illuminate the visual heirarchy of the
      page. Even though the content becomes a bit blurry it should remain clear
      what the major parts of the page are.
    </div>
    <p>Let's make the "h1" font "sans-serif" instead of the default "serif".</p>
    <p>Add this css rule to the "style" block:</p>
    <pre>
      h1 {
        font-family: sans-serif;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>Do the "h2" elements too.</p>
    <pre>
      h2 {
        font-family: sans-serif;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Looks like we're repeating ourselves a bit...we can condense two rules
      into one by using a <i>selector list</i>
    </p>
    <p>Replace the two rules for h1 and h2 with this single rule:</p>
    <pre>
      h1, h2 {
        font-family: sans-serif;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>Now let's make the CSS pop out a bit:</p>
    <p></p>
    <pre>
     pre {
      padding: 16px;
      border-radius: 0.5rem;
      border: dashed 2px lightblue;
      font-family: monospace;
    }
    </pre>
    <p>The complete style block should look like this now:</p>
    <pre>
        /* CSS goes here */
        body {
          margin: 0 auto;
          width: 95%;
          max-width: 440px;
          background-color: mintcream;
        }
        h1,
        h2 {
          font-family: sans-serif;
        }
        pre {
          padding: 16px;
          border-radius: 0.5rem;
          border: dashed 2px lightblue;
          font-family: monospace;
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Homework time... See if you can edit the styles yourself. Maybe
      `mintcream` isn't your favorite color?
